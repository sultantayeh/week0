        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>I have a lot of interests that fuel my passion for web development. Since I was young, I've enjoyed the colorful world of <span style="color: red; font-weight: 900;">Marvel</span>! The stories and characters have not only entertained me but also inspired my thinking. My fascination doesn't end there; I really enjoy collecting <span style="color: grey; font-weight: 900;">airplane</span> toys. The engineering behind each model makes me curiosity about design and functionality which are important for web projects.</p>
        <p>One of my proudest accomplishments is creating tools for <span style="color: orange; font-weight: 900;">Pokemon</span> fans. As a Pokemon player, I saw an opportunity to use my technical skills to create Pokemon applications. I developed an API that pulls fans any stat about Pokemon that you want!</p>
